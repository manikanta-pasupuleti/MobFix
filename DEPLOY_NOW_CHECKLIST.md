## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** Backend shows "Deploy failed"
- Check build logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET)
- Check MongoDB Atlas is accessible

**Problem:** "MongoDB connection failed"
- Verify MONGO_URI includes `/mobfix` database name
- Check Atlas network access allows 0.0.0.0/0
- Ensure Atlas cluster is not paused

**Problem:** Seed script fails
- Check if backend is running first
- Verify MongoDB connection works
- Try re-running the seed command

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** Build fails
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify package.json dependencies
- Check build logs for specific errors

**Problem:** Images don't load (404)
- Verify Unsplash URLs are accessible
- Check network tab in DevTools
- Test image URL directly in browser

**Problem:** Categories don't filter
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Problem:** Old services still showing
- Verify seed script ran successfully
- Check API response: https://mobfix-backend.onrender.com/api/services
- Re-run seed script if needed
